# Data Visualization of Flight Delays and Cancellations  


In this project, Iâ€™ll create visualizations to reveal insights, highlight patterns and tell a story from a data set.   

## The Datasets
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. You can find the dataset in supporting materials at the bottom of this page.

**Review the column Metadata** 

Some of the columns you want to use in your project will have coded values that represent longer more readable values. For instance the cancellation_reason column in the flights data set has the values: A, B, C, D These letters are not understandable by themselves. You need to replace these letters with the full reason to make your visualizations including this data more readable.

These letters correspond with the following reasons.

- A - Airline/Carrier

- B - Weather

- C - National Air System

- D - Security

 Review the Column Metadata tab on Kaggle for each data set to find details about the data like the one I have outlined above.

## What Software Do I Need?
For this project, i used [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/s/) Software to visualize the data.
